## 🎮 **Data Collection Protocol**

### **Session Structure**
```
Pre-Session Setup (5 min):
- Start CARLA server with optimized settings
- Spawn traffic (25 vehicles, 15 pedestrians)
- Position player vehicle at random spawn point

Recording Session (30-60 min):
- Continuous human driving with minimal interruptions
- Natural scenario encounters (traffic, intersections, pedestrians)
- Varied driving conditions (if weather/time variation enabled)
- Real-time action logging at 20Hz

Post-Session Processing (10 min):
- Automatic file saving with sequential naming
- Session metadata recording (duration, action count, etc.)
- Quality check (video playback, action log validation)
```

### **Data Quality Standards**
- **Minimum FPS**: 12fps for video recording
- **Action Sampling**: 20Hz (50ms intervals)
- **Synchronization**: <100ms between video frames and actions
- **Session Length**: 5-60 minutes per recording
- **Total Dataset**: Target 200+ usable samples (5-30 seconds each)

### **Scenario Coverage**
Natural driving will encounter:
- **Intersection Navigation**: Traffic lights, stop signs, turns
- **Highway Driving**: Merging, lane changes, following
- **Urban Environment**: Pedestrians, parking, narrow streets
- **Traffic Interaction**: Following, overtaking, yielding
- **Weather Variation**: Clear, rain, fog (if enabled)

## 🤖 **Model Training Approach**

### **Architecture: Vision-Language Model**
```python
Input: Video Frame (RGB) + Previous Actions + Context
  ↓
Vision Encoder: Process current visual scene
  ↓
Temporal Encoder: Understand sequence history
  ↓
Decision Layer: Predict next action + confidence
  ↓
Explanation Generator: Natural language reasoning
  ↓
Output: Action + Explanation Text
```

### **Training Data Format**
```json
{
  "timestamp": 1.25,
  "frame": "base64_encoded_image",
  "previous_actions": ["ACCELERATE", "ACCELERATE", "RIGHT"],
  "current_action": "ACCELERATE_RIGHT", 
  "context": {
    "speed": 15.2,
    "location": "intersection_approach",
    "traffic_detected": true
  },
  "explanation": "I'm turning right at this intersection while maintaining speed because the path is clear and I have right of way"
}
```

### **Training Objectives**
1. **Action Prediction**: Minimize action classification error
2. **Temporal Consistency**: Maintain smooth action sequences
3. **Explanation Coherence**: Generate logical reasoning text
4. **Safety Prioritization**: Bias toward conservative driving
